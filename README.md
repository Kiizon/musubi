# musubi 🍙

A dead simple macOS timer app.

## Why?

Because I'm not paying $20 for the onigiri timer app lol.

## What it does

- Set a timer from 0-120 minutes using a slider
- Quick presets for 5m, 10m, and 15m 
- Start/stop controls
- Plays a sound when the timer finishes
- Clean, minimal interface

## Tech

Built with SwiftUI for macOS.

## Running it

Open `musubi.xcodeproj` in Xcode and hit run.
